// MIN Protocol v2.0.
//
// MIN is a lightweight reliable protocol for exchanging information from a microcontroller (MCU) to a host.
// It is designed to run on an 8-bit MCU but also scale up to more powerful devices. A typical use case is to
// send data from a UART on a small MCU over a UART-USB converter plugged into a PC host. A Python implementation
// of host code is provided (or this code could be compiled for a PC).
//
// MIN supports frames of 0-255 bytes (with a lower limit selectable at compile time to reduce RAM). MIN frames
// have identifier values between 0 and 63.
//
// An optional transport layer T-MIN can be compiled in. This provides sliding window reliable transmission of frames.
//
// Compile options:
//
// -  Define NO_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL to remove the code and other overheads of dealing with transport frames. Any
//    transport frames sent from the other side are dropped.
//
// -  Define MAX_PAYLOAD if the size of the frames is to be limited. This is particularly useful with the transport
//    protocol where a deep FIFO is wanted but not for large frames.
//
// The API is as follows:
//
// -  min_init_context()
//    A MIN context is a structure allocated by the programmer that stores details of the protocol. This permits
//    the code to be reentrant and multiple serial ports to be used. The port parameter is used in a callback to
//    allow the programmer's serial port drivers to place bytes in the right port. In a typical scenario there will
//    be just one context.
//
// -  min_send_frame()
//    This sends a non-transport frame and will be dropped if the line is noisy.
//
// -  min_queue_frame()
//    This queues a transport frame which will will be retransmitted until the other side receives it correctly.
//
// -  min_poll()
//    This passes in received bytes to the context associated with the source. Note that if the transport protocol
//    is included then this must be called regularly to operate the transport state machine even if there are no
//    incoming bytes.
//
// There are several callbacks: these must be provided by the programmer and are called by the library:
//
// -  min_tx_space()
//    The programmer's serial drivers must return the number of bytes of space available in the sending buffer.
//    This helps cut down on the number of lost frames (and hence improve throughput) if a doomed attempt to transmit a
//    frame can be avoided.
//
// -  min_tx_byte()
//    The programmer's drivers must send a byte on the given port. The implementation of the serial port drivers
//    is in the domain of the programmer: they might be interrupt-based, polled, etc.
//
// -  min_application_handler()
//    This is the callback that provides a MIN frame received on a given port to the application. The programmer
//    should then deal with the frame as part of the application.
//
// -  min_time_ms()
//    This is called to obtain current time in milliseconds. This is used by the MIN transport protocol to drive
//    timeouts and retransmits.
